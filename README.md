## Overview
In this challenge lab, you will apply the skills learned from the Prompt Design in Vertex AI and Gemini course to complete a series of tasks independently. The lab is designed to test your ability to create effective prompts and use them in real-world scenarios involving generative AI within Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform. Successfully completing all tasks within the given time period will result in a 100% score, evaluated by an automated scoring system.

## Topics Tested
- Crafting effective prompts and utilizing parameters to guide generative AI output in Vertex AI Studio.
- Applying Gemini models to create product descriptions and taglines for marketing campaigns.
- Running and modifying Python code exported from Vertex AI Studio to implement generative AI solutions.
- Using Jupyter Notebooks to test and refine generative AI code.

## Challenge Scenario
You are part of an educational content startup that has partnered with Cymbal Direct, an online retailer launching a new line of outdoor gear and apparel. Your objective is to develop tools using Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform to streamline the creation of:
- **Evocative Product Descriptions**: Generate short, descriptive text inspired by product images.
- **Catchy Taglines**: Create engaging taglines that highlight product features and evoke specific emotional responses.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Build a Gemini Image Analysis Tool
1. **Download and Analyze Image**: Use the Gemini model in Vertex AI Studio to analyze product images and generate descriptive text options.
2. **Experiment with Prompts**: Create different prompts to generate various text styles, including simple descriptions, catchy phrases, and poetic descriptions.
3. **Save the Prompt**: Name the prompt "Cymbal Product Analysis" and save it in the us-central1 region.

### Task 2: Build a Gemini Tagline Generator
1. **Create a Customizable Tagline Generator**: Use the Gemini language model to design a structured prompt for generating taglines based on product attributes, target audience, and emotional resonance.
2. **Design and Test Prompt**: Include examples in the prompt to guide the output style and test different parameter combinations to refine the results.
3. **Save the Prompt**: Name the prompt "Cymbal Tagline Generator Template" and save it in the us-central1 region.

### Task 3: Experiment with Image Analysis Code
1. **Explore and Modify Python Code**: Export the Python code for the image analysis prompt and modify it to produce more creative descriptions.
2. **Test the Code**: Use Jupyter Notebooks to test the modified prompt and verify the new output.

### Task 4: Experiment with Tagline Generation Code
1. **Create and Test Notebook**: Create a new notebook for the tagline generator prompt, include example inputs and outputs, and test the code.
2. **Modify the Prompt**: Update the prompt to include a specific keyword and verify the new tagline output.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prompt-design-vertex-ai.git
